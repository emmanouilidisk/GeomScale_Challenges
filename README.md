•	**Easy Task:**   
  This challenge aims at ensuring the successful compilation and run of Volesti package.   
  To test the installation of the package I sampled with sample_points()   
  from a 100 dimensional hypercube and visualized the result using the R extension.   
The resulting plot is the following:

•	**Medium Task**  
This challenge includes the implementation of randomized cutting plane method   
for Linear Programming problems as well as reporting performance benchmarks.
